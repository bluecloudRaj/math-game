<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p class="text-justify">You will be presented with a simple math question, consisting of a basic operation (+ - * /), two operands in range 1..10
  and a potential answer. Your goal is to tell whether the proposed answer is correct as fast as possible, using a simple
  yes/no choice.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p class="text-justify">The first player to submit a correct answer gets 1 point for the round and completes the round. All incorrect answers subtract
  a point from the players' score. Correct late answers do not affect the score. After completing the round all players
  are informed that the round is over and a new round starts in 5 seconds after the end of last one.</p>
